New
-	skipping designated URL in spider.  Use options to set the spider.
-	auto update menu and periodic check for update (Windows and Linux platform only).

Fix
-	the use of new external library caused slower performance of proxy.  Restored to older library.

3.2.12
======

New
-	Use newest external library for HTTP handling.
-	enable/disable spider to POST forms in options panel to avoid generating unwanted traffic (default to enable).
	This is requested by many users.
-	Decrease the number of possible combinations crawled by spider on forms with multiple SELECT/OPTIONS.
	This make crawling less resource consuming and lower chance to affect application being scanned.
-	Minor UI changes.

Fix
-	Fallback database library to previous version as in Paros 3.2.10 because of a problem with hsqldb where some byte combination may consume 100% cpu time.
-	Increase width of method display in history to cater for other longer method names.
-	Default file scans may display incorrect HTTP message body if the original message is a POST request.

3.2.11
======

New
-	Revamp History log panel.
-	Added "tag..." in right-click pop-up window for History log panel.  This help to quickly identify a HTTP message in History display.
-	Concurrent delete of multiple URL's in the site hierarchy (sf.net request ID 1472300).
-	Use of newest db library.

Fix
-	For POST request, if the body contain binary parameters of certain pattern, it may be unable to issue a re-send because URLDecode failed to decode properly.

3.2.10
======

Fix
-	Tracking session state problem reported (previously only restart can reset session state).
-	Paros startup problem when added server authentication into authentication panel.
-	Authentnciation entry reappear even after deleted (when proxy reloads).

3.2.9
=====
New
-	Continuous browser display when selecting in History panel.
-	Use final stable version of external library.
-	Record working directory for all subsequent file access within the same Paros instance.

Thanks to Christophe for the following:
-	Improved spider capability to crawl forms with textarea and handle links with "&amp;"
-	Improved check for cross-site script without bracket.
-	Improved check for PHP error and MySQL.
-	Improved blind sql check on double quotes.

Fix
-	if request body contain certain binary bytes it may cause unnecessary encoding.  Fixed to always submit contain binary bytes.
-	better handling of accepted-encoding.

3.2.8
=====
New
-	Major rewrite on proxy code for reducing memory overhead when proxy over HTTPS.
	This improves proxy performance over SSL, especially when there are lots of concurrent requests.

-	An experimental feature to support viewing selected history message in browser. This will open native browser
	to obtain cached result from the proxy.  Right now only Windows platform is supported.
	Note that the default browser (eg IE) must be configured to proxy via Paros.  For request unavailable from cache,
	it'll send out the new requests for display.
	
	This feature can be useful for post analysis.

-	Improved accuracy on autocomplete plugin check.
-	Use newest HSQLDB library (version 1.8.0.2).

Fix
-	Major bug fix that config.xml may grow on each option save.  This may cause OutofMemoryError when the application starts
	due to prolonged use of the application with frequent option change (eg several weeks).
-	Minor visual tuning, fix and rearrangement of pop-up menus.

3.2.7
=====

-	New Lotus Domino default files check.  Thanks to the user contributing this.

Fix
-	Further fix the security concern that hsqldb may still be accessed by local user on the same computer.
	Thanks to the user further point this out. Now hsqldb is running as in-process database.
-	bug in analyser.  Now correctly differentiate for fixed friendly 404 custom page.  Checks for default files are more accurate.
-	Find dialog does not work for Resend window.

3.2.6
=====

Fix
-	Fix a security problem that when hsqldb starts it listen to all interfaces and used default password.
	Now restrict to localhost only to avoid public exposure as this exposes database content and may allow unexpected stored procedures to be run.
	Thanks to the user reporting it.



3.2.5
=====

New
-	Improved proxy performance in browser response.
-	Increased UI responsiveness.

3.2.2
=====

New
-	Support command line spider, scanner and report generation.  This can be useful for scheduled scanning.
	
	Eg java -jar paros.jar -newsession test.session -spider -seed http://www.some_domain.org -scan -last_report_scan report.htm
	can create a new session called test, crawl the site, scan and then generate the report.
	
	The user can view the session by running normal GUI mode as usual.
-	Export selected history to file.  Right-click on the History panel to export the HTTP messages to a text file.	
-	Http state can be enabled (only support state using cookie).  This allow reuse of session for scanning.  Also improve spider accuracy.
